# AV Wedding — Next.js micro-site

This repo is a minimal Next.js project designed as a wedding micro-site. It includes a fast static guest lookup and pages for program and floor plan.

## Quick start
1. Paste these files into a new folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Push to GitHub.
2. Go to https://vercel.com → New Project → Import from GitHub and pick this repo.
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and deploy.

## Customising
- Edit `public/guests.json` to update guest list.
- Replace `/public/floorplan.jpg` with your venue floor plan.
- Tweak colours in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Optional enhancements I can add
- Interactive floor plan with clickable/highlightable tables.
- Offline support / PWA.
- Custom domain + QR image.
